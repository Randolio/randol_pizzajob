**Changes** - Last updated: 26/01/2024

* Added support for both ESX/QB/ND frameworks.
* Utilized ox lib throughout.
* Configs are now split into client and server configs. (config.lua and sv_config.lua)
* When starting work, you are generated a set number of locations to deliver pizzas to (10 by default) and are paid per delivery. Once completed all 10, you must return the vehicle.
* No more duplicate locations.
* Vehicle is now created server side and the whole script was rewritten to secure any exploits.
